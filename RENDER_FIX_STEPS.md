# Fix Render Authentication Issues - Action Required

## The Problem
Your Render deployment is failing because JWT tokens are invalid. This happens when JWT_SECRET in production doesn't match what was used to create the tokens.

## Fix Steps (Do This Now):

### 1. Update Render Environment Variables
Go to your Render dashboard → Your service → Environment:

Set this EXACT value:
```
JWT_SECRET=your-super-long-secret-key-12345678901234567890
```

### 2. Push Code Changes to GitHub
The code fixes are ready. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix JWT authentication for production"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Render Will Auto-Deploy
Wait 3-5 minutes for Render to redeploy automatically.

### 4. Clear Browser Storage & Login Fresh
- Open your Render URL: https://onlinelearningplatform-ppes.onrender.com
- Clear browser localStorage (F12 → Application → Local Storage → Clear)
- Login again with admin credentials
- Test admin features

## What Was Fixed:
- JWT_SECRET now uses environment variable instead of hardcoded value
- CORS updated to include Render domain
- All authentication middleware is properly configured

## Test These After Fix:
- Login as admin
- Access user management
- View pending approvals
- Check student test results
- Course management

The authentication system is correctly implemented - it just needed the environment variable fix.
